AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales and executes your code in response to various events, such as HTTP requests, database changes, file uploads, or scheduled tasks.

### Key Features of AWS Lambda
- **Serverless**: No infrastructure management is required.
- **Event-driven**: Executes in response to events.
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for the compute time used.
- **Auto-scaling**: Scales automatically based on the event volume.
- **Supports multiple languages**: Python, Java, Go, Node.js, Ruby, and more.

### Steps to Create an AWS Lambda Function

#### **Step 1: Access the AWS Lambda Console**
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to **Lambda** under the Compute section.

---

#### **Step 2: Create a Function**
1. Click on **Create function**.
2. Choose a creation method:
   - **Author from scratch**: Write your own code.
   - **Use a blueprint**: Use predefined templates for common use cases.
   - **Container image**: Use Docker images for the function.
3. Fill in the required details:
   - **Function name**: Enter a unique name for your function.
   - **Runtime**: Select a runtime (e.g., Python 3.9, Node.js 14.x).
   - **Permissions**: Create or choose an IAM role for the function to access other AWS services.

---

#### **Step 3: Write or Upload Code**
1. **Inline Editor**: Use the built-in code editor to write your function.
2. **Upload a file**: Upload a `.zip` file containing your code and dependencies.
3. **Use S3**: Provide the S3 bucket URL containing your code.
4. **Container image**: Use a container stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

---

#### **Step 4: Configure Triggers**
1. Specify the event source that will trigger the function:
   - API Gateway
   - S3 Bucket
   - DynamoDB
   - CloudWatch Events, etc.
2. Add triggers in the **Add Trigger** section.

---

#### **Step 5: Set Environment Variables (Optional)**
- Define key-value pairs to customize function behavior without changing the code.

---

#### **Step 6: Adjust Function Settings**
1. **Timeout**: Set the maximum execution time (default: 3 seconds).
2. **Memory**: Allocate memory to your function (more memory = higher compute power).
3. **VPC Settings**: Connect the function to a Virtual Private Cloud (if needed).

---

#### **Step 7: Test the Function**
1. Create a test event in the Lambda console.
2. Provide sample input JSON for the event.
3. Click **Test** and view the results in the console.

---

#### **Step 8: Monitor and Debug**
- Use **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** for debugging.
- Enable AWS X-Ray for detailed tracing.

Here's a sample Python code for an AWS Lambda function that triggers on an S3 event (like uploading a file) and sends a notification using Amazon SNS.

---

### **Use Case**
- **Trigger**: S3 bucket event (e.g., file uploaded).
- **Action**: Send an SNS notification with the file details.

---

### **Lambda Function Code**

```python
import boto3
import json
import logging

# Configure logging
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Initialize the SNS client
sns_client = boto3.client('sns')

# Replace with your SNS topic ARN
SNS_TOPIC_ARN = "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:YourSNSTopic"

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    """
    Lambda function triggered by S3 event to send an SNS notification.
    """
    try:
        # Extract bucket name and object key from the event
        bucket_name = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
        object_key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
        
        # Log the details
        logger.info(f"File uploaded: Bucket={bucket_name}, Key={object_key}")
        
        # Message for the SNS topic
        message = {
            "bucket_name": bucket_name,
            "file_name": object_key
        }
        message_str = json.dumps(message)
        
        # Publish to SNS topic
        response = sns_client.publish(
            TopicArn=SNS_TOPIC_ARN,
            Message=message_str,
            Subject="New File Uploaded to S3"
        )
        
        logger.info(f"SNS Notification sent: {response}")
        
        return {
            "statusCode": 200,
            "body": json.dumps("Notification sent successfully!")
        }
    
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
        return {
            "statusCode": 500,
            "body": json.dumps("An error occurred while sending notification.")
        }
```

### **Steps to Implement**

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**:
   - Go to the S3 console and create a bucket.
   - Enable event notifications for the bucket.
   - Configure an event to trigger the Lambda function on actions like `PUT` (file upload).

2. **Create an SNS Topic**:
   - Go to the SNS console and create a topic.
   - Note the **Topic ARN** and replace it in the code.
   - Subscribe to the topic (e.g., email, SMS, etc.).

3. **Create an IAM Role**:
   - Attach the following policies to the role:
     - `AmazonS3FullAccess` or specific permissions for the bucket.
     - `AmazonSNSFullAccess` or specific permissions for the SNS topic.

4. **Deploy the Lambda Function**:
   - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to deploy the function.
   - Ensure the Lambda function is configured to trigger on S3 bucket events.

5. **Test the Setup**:
   - Upload a file to the S3 bucket.
   - Check the SNS subscription (e.g., email inbox) for the notification.
