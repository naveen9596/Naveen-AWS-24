### **Beginner Scenarios**

1. **Scenario**: Launching an EC2 Instance  
   **Question**: How do you launch an EC2 instance and configure it to allow SSH access?  
   **Solution**:  
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.  
   - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard and click "Launch Instance."  
   - Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), e.g., Amazon Linux 2.  
   - Choose an instance type, e.g., t2.micro.  
   - Configure key pair and security group to allow SSH (port 22).  
   - Review and launch the instance.  
   - Use the private key file to SSH into the instance.

2. **Scenario**: Setting Up an S3 Bucket  
   **Question**: How do you create an S3 bucket to store files and make them publicly accessible?  
   **Solution**:  
   - Open the S3 service and click "Create Bucket."  
   - Name the bucket and choose the region.  
   - Disable "Block Public Access" if needed.  
   - Upload files and set the object's permissions to "Public" under "Access Control List."  
   - Use the object URL to access the file.

3. **Scenario**: Creating an IAM User  
   **Question**: How do you create an IAM user with programmatic access and attach a specific policy?  
   **Solution**:  
   - Open the IAM service and click "Add users."  
   - Enter the user name and select "Programmatic access."  
   - Attach a policy (e.g., AmazonS3FullAccess).  
   - Review and create the user.  
   - Save the access key and secret for API usage.

### **Intermediate Scenarios**

4. **Scenario**: Hosting a Static Website Using S3  
   **Question**: How do you host a static website using S3 with a custom domain?  
   **Solution**:  
   - Create an S3 bucket and enable "Static website hosting" under "Properties."  
   - Upload website files and set them to public.  
   - Use Route 53 to configure a custom domain by creating an A record pointing to the S3 bucket.  
   - Ensure bucket policies allow public access to the files.

5. **Scenario**: Setting Up Auto Scaling  
   **Question**: How do you configure auto-scaling for a web application running on EC2 instances?  
   **Solution**:  
   - Create a Launch Configuration or Launch Template with the required EC2 configuration.  
   - Set up an Auto Scaling group with the desired number of instances.  
   - Define scaling policies (e.g., scale-out when CPU > 70%).  
   - Attach a Load Balancer to distribute traffic across the instances.

6. **Scenario**: Configuring RDS with High Availability  
   **Question**: How do you create an RDS instance with Multi-AZ deployment?  
   **Solution**:  
   - Open the RDS service and click "Create database."  
   - Choose the database engine (e.g., MySQL).  
   - Enable "Multi-AZ deployment" during the configuration.  
   - Configure backup settings and security groups.  
   - Launch the RDS instance.

### **Advanced Scenarios**

7. **Scenario**: Implementing Disaster Recovery  
   **Question**: How do you design a disaster recovery strategy using AWS services?  
   **Solution**:  
   - Use S3 Cross-Region Replication for data redundancy.  
   - Set up Route 53 for DNS failover using health checks.  
   - Deploy applications in multiple regions with AWS Global Accelerator.  
   - Automate recovery with AWS Backup and Disaster Recovery Plans.

8. **Scenario**: Building a CI/CD Pipeline  
   **Question**: How do you build a CI/CD pipeline using CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy?  
   **Solution**:  
   - Use CodePipeline to define stages (Source, Build, Deploy).  
   - Integrate CodeCommit (or GitHub) as the source repository.  
   - Use CodeBuild for building and testing the application.  
   - Configure CodeDeploy to deploy the application to EC2 instances.  
   - Test the pipeline with a sample commit.

9. **Scenario**: Setting Up AWS Lambda for Serverless Architecture  
   **Question**: How do you create a Lambda function triggered by an S3 event?  
   **Solution**:  
   - Write a Lambda function in Python/Node.js to process S3 events.  
   - Create an S3 bucket and enable event notifications.  
   - Configure the notification to invoke the Lambda function on object creation.  
   - Test by uploading a file to S3 and verifying Lambda execution.

10. **Scenario**: Optimizing Costs with Reserved Instances  
    **Question**: How do you reduce EC2 costs for predictable workloads?  
    **Solution**:  
    - Analyze usage patterns using AWS Cost Explorer.  
    - Purchase Reserved Instances for consistent workloads.  
    - Use Savings Plans to optimize additional services.  
    - Set up Budgets and Alerts to monitor costs.
