## **1. Introduction to Serverless Computing (10 mins)**

### ✅ Talking Points:
- **Definition**: Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications without managing infrastructure.
- **Clarification**: Servers still exist — but they’re abstracted away from the developer.
- **Why Serverless?**
  - Faster time to market
  - Auto-scaling
  - Event-driven
  - Pay only when functions run

### ✅ Benefits:
- Zero infrastructure management
- Reduced costs (especially for intermittent workloads)
- Scalability and agility

### ✅ Use Cases:
- Image processing
- Chatbots
- Real-time notifications
- Scheduled tasks (cron jobs)
- Backend for mobile/web apps

### ✅ Comparison:
| Traditional Cloud | Serverless |
|------------------|------------|
| Provision VMs/containers | Upload functions |
| Pay for uptime | Pay per execution |
| Manual scaling | Auto-scaling |
| Ops/DevOps needed | No ops overhead |

## **2. Core Concepts & Technologies (20 mins)**

### ✅ Function-as-a-Service (FaaS):
- Execute short-lived, stateless functions on demand
- Triggered by events (e.g., HTTP, file upload, DB change)
- Supports multiple runtimes (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)

### ✅ Serverless Backend Services:
- **Storage**: Amazon S3, Azure Blob, GCP Cloud Storage
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito, Firebase Auth
- **Database**: DynamoDB, Firebase Realtime DB, Aurora Serverless

### ✅ Key Providers:
| Cloud | FaaS Service |
|-------|--------------|
| AWS | AWS Lambda |
| Azure | Azure Functions |
| GCP | Google Cloud Functions |

### ✅ Hands-on (optional/demo):
- Console walkthrough of AWS Lambda function
- Trigger Lambda with an S3 file upload

---

## **3. Understanding Serverless Pricing & Cost Optimization (20 mins)**

### ✅ Pricing Model:
- **AWS Lambda**: Charges per request + duration of execution
  - Free tier: 1M invocations + 400,000 GB-seconds per month
- **Azure/GCP**: Similar pay-per-use model

### ✅ Cost-saving Techniques:
- Right-size function memory
- Reduce execution time
- Use provisioned concurrency only when needed
- Avoid excessive retries

### ✅ Efficient Resource Management:
- Set function timeouts
- Use async processing for heavy tasks
- Monitor usage via CloudWatch or equivalent

---

## **4. Serverless Application Design Patterns (20 mins)**

### ✅ Event-Driven Architecture:
- Events (like S3 upload, DB update) trigger functions
- Use cases: Notification services, processing pipelines

### ✅ Microservices with Serverless:
- Build modular, independently deployable services
- Use API Gateway for REST endpoints
- Example flow: User registration → Save to DB → Send email

### ✅ Common Pitfalls:
- Cold starts
- Debugging complexity
- Vendor lock-in

### ✅ Best Practices:
- Keep functions small and single-purpose
- Use environment variables
- Separate business logic from cloud SDK calls

---

## **5. Security & Monitoring in Serverless (20 mins)**

### ✅ Securing Serverless Apps:
- Follow the **Principle of Least Privilege** (IAM roles)
- Validate input data
- Secure sensitive info (secrets manager / env vars)

### ✅ Monitoring Tools:
- **AWS CloudWatch Logs**
- **Azure Monitor**
- **GCP Cloud Logging**

### ✅ Managing Performance:
- Use provisioned concurrency for latency-sensitive apps
- Use **X-Ray** or **OpenTelemetry** for tracing
- Set alerts on error rate, latency, throttling

---

## **6. Wrap-Up & Q&A (10 mins)**

### ✅ Summary:
- Serverless is ideal for modern, event-driven, and cost-efficient applications
- Best suited for dynamic workloads
- Use managed services for storage, auth, DB to reduce overhead

### ✅ Bonus:
- Share reference links:
